    "## Extracting data from ESRI Map Servers\n",
    "More and more organizations are hosting their data on ESRI Map Servers, giving us access to these datasets via \"ArcGIS REST Service Endpoints\". For example, NC OneMap provides access to a wealth of data here:https://services.nconemap.gov/secure/rest/services. This means there's a huge wealth of data we can access - either to download locally or use directly - if only we know how to access it. And to do that, we need to learn the [ESRI REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/get-started-with-the-services-directory.htm). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore two particularly useful web services provided in the ESRI REST API: The `Export Map` service applied to a `MapServer` service, and the `Query` service applied to a specific `Feature Layer` within a `MapService`. (What those are will be clear as we move along in this exercise...)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine these web services first from with a web browser, which is a handy way to explore what's what, and then we'll convey this knowledge of the API to the Python scripting environment, which is a much more powerful means for tapping into the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "By no means is this an exhaustive look at the ESRI REST API, but it should give you a good foundation for seeing how these web services work, both in a web browser and within Python so that you can continue to learn more on your own."

    "The Export Map service produces a figure of the spatial data with constraints we give it. These constraints can include: a <u>zoom</u> to a particular region, showing only <u>specific layers</u> listed in the map service, and showing only <u>specific features</u> in a given layer. Here, we explore how to do that using the NC OneMap's Census Map Service. \n",
